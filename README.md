Jenga-Icons is a flexible icon family for interfaces, diagrams, presentations â€” whatever, really.

- 1000+ icons and counting (all the icons will be added soon)
- Regular, Fill, and Duotone
- Designed at 16 x 16px to read well small and scale up big
- Raw stroke information retained to fine-tune the style
